# The Library
### main.py
- Primary functions (add, reading status, lending status, search)
- Driver file (launch function)

### data.py
- Outline of Book class and internal functions

### library.txt & opus.txt
- Contains example **readable**  collection of entered books
- Data per book includes title, author, ISBN, reading & lending status

**_NOTE: No unit tests could be made since all functions require user input. Test by running main.py and trying each function using manual inputs.
Also, all code was written by both Jason Judin and Elliot DeJong so each function is not labeled with one name._**
